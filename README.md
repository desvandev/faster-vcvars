# faster-vcvars
Batch script to setup environmental variables for Visual Studio compiler without having to use the infamous Developer Console

**Disclaimer:** This script can be rewritten to be 0.05ms faster. It has some unnecesary variable declarations to be more noob friendly.

Usage:
```cmd
::Inside cmd.exe
> faster-vcvars.bat 64
```
Change 64 to 32 if you need to compile to x86
